# egoismsimulation
The objective of this program is to study, in a simple environment, the interaction between people with different levels of egoism. We run a simulation where people need to eat to survive and reproduce, and they can team up to hunt, giving them more food. The repartition of the cows they hunt is determined by the 2 levels of egoism.
